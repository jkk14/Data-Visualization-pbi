Academic Performance Analysis

Overview

This project provides insights into student academic records using Power BI. The dataset includes information on students' gender, programs of study, and CGPA trends across different levels (100 to 400). The visualizations help identify trends, distributions, and patterns in academic performance.

Key Insights

1. Gender Distribution of Graduates

A donut chart visualizes the proportion of male and female graduates.

This helps in understanding gender representation in the dataset.

2. Number of Graduates Across Programs

A bar chart displays the count of graduates per academic program.

Useful for identifying which programs have the highest and lowest number of graduates.

3. Average CGPA Trends from Level 100 to 400

A stacked column chart illustrates the average CGPA progression per program from Level 100 to Level 400.

Helps analyze academic performance consistency across programs and levels.
